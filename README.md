README research_fall2020

Week 1 (09/15 - 09/22):
- Indtroduced to project
- Created database generating function that returns a list of hashed coordinate values


Week 2 (09/22 - 09/29):
- Changed database to be a 2D numpy array that stores a list of hashed coordinate values at each index
- Produced leakage list function, returns a list of queries where each query containts a list of the points with values in the query, some of which are lists of multiple points at the same coordinate.
- Began looking into tensorflow neural net tutorials, looked at classifying MNIST dataset


Week 3 (09/29 - 10/06):
- Wrote function that turns leakage list into 2D numpy array of dimensions (number of queries, length of longest query), this will be what is fed into the neural net
- Looked at another tensorflow neural net tutorial classifying Fashion MNIST dataset, also have been using tensorflow for CNN's in my Deep Learning class
